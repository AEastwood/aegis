# Aegis

**Aegis** is a hardware fingerprinting-based security module designed to serve as a second factor of authentication (2FA). It strengthens access control by uniquely identifying client machines based on physical hardware attributes, providing an additional security layer beyond traditional credential-based authentication.

## Key Features

- Robust hardware fingerprinting for device recognition
- Seamless 2FA enforcement via device identity
- Lightweight, low-overhead implementation
- Compatible with modern authentication flows
- Suitable for desktop, embedded, or enterprise applications

## Intended Use Cases

- Securing user authentication with device-level verification
- Enforcing device-specific access policies
- Reducing risk of credential theft and session hijacking
- Complementing existing security infrastructure

## Getting Started
